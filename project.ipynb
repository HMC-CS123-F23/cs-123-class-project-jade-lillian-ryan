    "**Summary**: Users will be able to perform vector operations on rays that are simulating photons and render a realistic image of a dining room scene. This will provide insight into how we as programmers simplify and approximate real-life physics into something computable with finite memory and time, which is a good step into more complex concepts in computer graphics, such as simulating water, snow, fire, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience**: Students who are familiar with Python and basic vector geometry, but haven't had much experience with computer graphics. These individuals are interested in simulating light in a virtual environment and learning about how computers render images, but not necessarily a complex graphics engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Libraries used**: `NumPy`, `matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary**: rays, vector operations, pixels, images, computer graphics, physics, virtual camera, image"
